# brayden-cyber-lab

Journey from baseline → practical offensive capability. This repo is my lab notebook and portfolio while I learn pentesting and reverse engineering.

## Repo contents
- `writeups/` — TryHackMe & HackTheBox writeups (lab-only, legal)
- `tools/` — small scripts I build to help workflows (activity logging, parsers)
- `templates/` — writeup templates, checklists
- `activities.json` — central activity state (gym, study, sleep entries)

## Short-term goals (first 12 weeks)
1. Complete TryHackMe Pre-Security + Linux fundamentals.
2. Publish 6 writeups to `writeups/`.
3. Build a small Python tool (`tools/log_activity.py`) to record gym & study check-ins.
4. Prepare for an entry practical cert (eJPT / TryHackMe pathway).

## How to use this repo
- Add every solved lab to `writeups/` with a short notes file.
- Use `tools/log_activity.py` to mark gym/study sessions — it updates `activities.json`.
- Keep the README updated with progress and certificates.
