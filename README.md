# brayden-cyber-lab
Journey from baseline to offensive security capability.
This repo stores:
- TryHackMe writeups (legal labs only)
- HackTheBox starting point writeups
- Notes on tools (Nmap, Gobuster, Wireshark, etc.)
- Scripts I build along the way

- Goal: Become high-skill and publicly respected in offensive security.
